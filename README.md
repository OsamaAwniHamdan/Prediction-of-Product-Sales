By examining the correlation heat map, we gain an insightful overview of a positive correlation between **Item_MRP** (Maximum Retail Price) and **Item_Outlet_Sales**. This suggests that higher-priced items tend to generate higher sales in the outlets. Understanding this relationship can help retailers strategically price their products and stock their stores to maximize revenue. 
Analyzing such correlations is crucial for making data-driven decisions that enhance sales performance and optimize overall business strategies

The correlation heatmap suggests a positive relationship between Item_MRP (Maximum Retail Price) and Item_Outlet_Sales. This is further confirmed by a scatterplot with a trendline, which shows that the trendline increases as Item_MRP rises. This indicates that higher-priced items tend to have higher sales in the outlets.
